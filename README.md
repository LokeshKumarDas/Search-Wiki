# Search-Wiki

In this project i created a streamlit app to generate a text summary of given query(Using wikipedia as source) webscrapping for data collection and to summarize the data i used T5(small) Transformer(Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

How to use : 
1 : Download all the Libraries used in 'app.py' and 'Search_Wiki.ipynb'.
2 : Run all the cells of 'Search_Wiki.ipynb'.
3 : We will get the 'verification key'.
4 : We have to visit 'External URL' and submit 'verification key' to launch 'app.py' on streamlit server.
5 : Type any keywords and click on 'Search' button to get some response generated.

We will first get the sources(websites) to collect information and further some basic summary from data collected from these websites
Note : app.py sometimes take longer time to generate response also sometimes different keywords or more description helps to generate better results.
