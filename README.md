# Search-Wiki

In this project i created a streamlit app to generate a text summary of given query(Using wikipedia as source) webscrapping for data collection and to summarize the data i used T5(small) Transformer(Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer).<br />

**How to use** : <br />
1 : Download all the Libraries used in 'app.py' and 'Search_Wiki.ipynb'.<br />
2 : Run all the cells of 'Search_Wiki.ipynb'.<br />
3 : We will get the 'verification key'.<br />
4 : We have to visit 'External URL' and submit 'verification key' to launch 'app.py' on streamlit server.<br />
5 : Type any keywords and click on 'Search' button to get some response generated.<br />

We will first get the sources(websites) to collect information and further some basic summary from data collected from these websites.<br />
**Note** : 'app.py' sometimes take longer time to generate response also different keywords or more description helps to generate better results.
